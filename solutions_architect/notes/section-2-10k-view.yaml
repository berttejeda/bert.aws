  topic: Regions vs Availability Zones
  content: |-
    Availability Zone == Data Center (building filled with servers)
      An Availability Zone (AZ) is a distinct location within an AWS Region. Each Region comprises at least two AZs.
    Can be more than 1 Data Center
    Region == A geographical area, 2 or more Availability Zones
      Each region is a separate geographic area. 
      Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.
      A region is a geographical area divided into Availability Zones. Each region contains at least two Availability Zones.
    Regions
      - North America
      - South America
      - EMEA
      - APAC
    Edge network Locations
      - CDN
      - CloudFront content is cached in Edge Locations.
    The number of Edge Locations is greater than the number of Availability Zones, 
    which is greater than the number of Regions.
