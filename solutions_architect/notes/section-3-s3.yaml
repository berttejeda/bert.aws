  topic: What are the Key fundamentals of Amazon S3?
  content: |-
    S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides developers and IT teams
    with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
    It is a safe place to store your files.
    - Object-based storage
      - Key (Name of the object)
      - Value (the data is made up of a sequence of bytes)
      - Version (Version ID)
      - Metadata (data about the data you are storing)
      - Subresources
        - Access Control Lists (object/bucket-level permissions)
        - Torrents
    - Spread across multiple devices and facilities
    - 0 Bytes to 5TB
    - Unlimited Storage
    - Files are stored in buckets (a.k.a folders)
    - S3 is a universal namespace, that is, bucket names must be unique globally
      e.g. 
        https://acloudguru.s3.amazonaws.com (if created in the default region Northern Virginia)
        or
        https://acloudguru.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com (if created in Ireland for example)
    - File uploads return an HTTP 200 code if file upload is successful
    - Not suitable to install an operating system on (use block storage for that)

  topic: How does data consistency work for S3?
  content: |-
    - Read after Write for PUTS of new Objects
      If you write a new file and read it immediately,
      afterwards, you will be able to view the data
    - Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS 
      and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
      If you update AN EXISTING file or delete a file,
      and read it immediately, you may or may not get the 
      older version. This is because changes can take time to 
      propagate

  topic: What are some considerations when selecting your S3 storage tier
  content: |-
    Pricing is at cents per Gig per month
    - Frequency of Requests
    - Number of Objects
    - Amount of Data
    examples:
    Scenario: You are storing OS templates with a non-predictable pattern of requests
    Consideratios:
      You might think that S3 Standard would suffice for your files,
      however, do consider S3 Intelligent Tiering instead, as the feature
      might switch your storage tier to Infrequent Access, which roughly half that
      of the S3 Standard
    S3 - Intelligent Tiering should be used in place of S3 Standard, unless
    you have a high number of objects

  topic: Describe S3 encryption
  content: |-
    Encryption In Transit is achieved by 
      - SSL/TLS
    Encryption At Rest (Server Side) is achieved by
      - S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption S3)
      - Keys - SSE-KMS
      - Server Side Encryption With Customer-Provided Keys - SSE-C
    Client Side Encryption
    Encryption can be done at the Bucket or Object Level

  topic: Describe Versioning in S3
  content: |-
    - Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)
    - Serves as a backup tool
    - Once enabled on a bucket, cannot be disabled, only suspended
      Must delete a bucket and create a new one in order to disabled
    - Integrates with Lifecycle rules
    - MFA Delete capability, which provides an additional layer of security for your objects
  keywords: aws, fso, s3, storage, encryption, security
-
  topic: What happens when you delete a versioned object in an S3 bucket?
  content: |-
    A delete marker is placed on the object, which causes the object
    to be hidden from regular viewing.
    In order to list the file and its versions, you'll have to enable the
    list-versions option.
    To undo your delete,  you'll have to delete the delete marker.
    Deleting versions of your file cannot be undone, as these are not affixed 
    a delete marker

-
  topic: Describe Lifecycle Rules
  content: |-
    Lifecycle Rules govern how S3 objects are mananaged
    - This automates moving your objects between storage tiers
    - Can be used in conjunction with versioning
    - Can be applied to current versions and previous versions
    Rule Scope:
      Limit Scope
      Entire Bucket
    Once you finish adding your transitions, you can review the actions by 
    scrolling down to the Timeline summary

  topic: Describe S3 Object and Glacier Vault Lock
  content: |-
    Use the S3 Object Lock to store objects using write-once read many (WORM) model.
    It can help you prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a fixed amount
    of time or indefinitely.
    You can also use it as an extra layer of protection against modification/deletion
    Come in two modes:
      - Governance Mode
        Users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings
        unless they have special permissions.
      - Compliance Mode
        A protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, 
        including the root user!
        Ensures the S3 object is protected for the duration of the retention period
        When you place a retention period on an object version, AWS S3 stores a timestamp
        in the object version's metadata
    Legal Holds
      Prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted
      However a legal hold doesn't have an associated retention period and
      remains in effect until removed. These can be freelly placed and removed by
      any user who has the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission

    S3 Glacier Vault Lock Allows you to easily deploy and enforce compliance controls
    for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a Vault Lock policy.
    Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

  topic: What's the difference between S3 Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock?
  content: |-
    - Object lock is for S3 objects in S3
      - Governance Mode
      - Compliance Mode
    - Glacier Vault Lock is for vaults inside of S3 Glacier

  topic: Describe some aspects of S3 Performance
  content: |-
    Extremely low latency
    You can get the first byte out of S3 within 100-200 milliseconds
  keywords: aws, fso, s3, storage, performance, latency
-
  topic: What are some actions you can take to improve S3 Performance?
  content: |-
    S3 offers a High number of requests per second, per prefix:
      - 3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE
      - 5,500 GET/HEAD requests 
    You can get better performance by spreading your reads across
    different prefixes
    e.g. 
      - 2 prefixes == 11,000 requests per second
      - 4 prefixes == 22,000 requests per second
    Implement multipart uploads
      - Recommended for files > 100MB
      - Required for files over 5GB
      - Parallelize uploads (increases efficiency)
    Implement S3 Byte-Range Fetches for downloads
      - Parallelize downoads by specifying byte ranges
      - Failures are isolated to specific byte ranges
      - Speeds up downloads
      - Can be used to download parts of a file (e.g. header information)
  keywords: aws, fso, s3, storage, performance, latency, speed, design, considerations, improvements, efficiency
-
  topic: What are some considerations you should keep in mind regarding S3 Performance and encryption?
  content: |-
    - If using SSE-KMS Encryption, you must keep in mind the KMS limits
      - Upload/Download counts against the region-specific KMS quota
        - 5,400, 10,000, or 30,000 per second
      - You cannot request a quota increase for KMS
    - When you upload a file, you will call GenerateDataKey in the KMS API
    - When you download a file, you will call Decrypt in the KMS API
